## Tetris controlled by color tracking

* Written in js.
* Powered by p5.js graphics library.
* Provides connection between objects moving in real time and tetris blocks via color tracking.
* Doesn't on all machines (err: Index or size is negative or greater than the allowed amount; line 33 in p5.min.js). 
* This error is not caused by the p5 library, but by us. We're open to suggestions if you know what the problem might be.
